A repository on medubiq, a project to assist remote physical assesment based on Particle Argon. The project was developed for fulfilling the [[1079I] - ROBOT PROGRAMMING FRAMEWORKS AND IOT PLATFORMS](https://unipi.coursecatalogue.cineca.it/insegnamenti/2024/52656_692629_77416/2015/52658/10970?coorte=2024&schemaid=9001) course requirement. This particular repository contains the code of web based graphical user interface of the project. The link to device's firmwares are available [here](https://github.com/Jahneel/IoT_Project) for the sensor server part, and [here](https://github.com/Akshayraj-09/Pseudohaptics) for the pseudohaptic part.
